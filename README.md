\## 🧠 Overview

This project analyzes the \*\*2009 MotoGP season\*\* using historical race data

combined with \*\*machine learning–based win probability analysis\*\*.



The primary objective of this project is \*\*performance analysis\*\*, not future

race prediction. Machine learning models are applied to estimate race-level

win probabilities in order to understand rider consistency and competitive

patterns across different circuits.



🏆 \*\*Valentino Rossi\*\*, the MotoGP World Champion of 2009, is highlighted

to reflect his dominance during the season.
